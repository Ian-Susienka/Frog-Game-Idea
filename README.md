# Frog-Game-Idea
It is a 2-d dungeon roguelike game
where you play as a character that is trying to get through a dungeon but if killed you have to restart from the beging of the game.
We will be trying to implement random map generation, random loot drop, health packs, and enemys that are trying to kill the player.
